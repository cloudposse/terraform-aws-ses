# Short description of this project
description: |-
  Terraform module to provision Simple Email Service on AWS.
# How to use this project
usage: |-
  This module creates a SES domain with IAM user that is able to send emails with it.
  If module is provided with Route53 Zone ID or Cloudfront Zone ID it can also create verification DNS records for domain and DKIM.

  For a complete example, see [examples/complete](examples/complete).

  For automated tests of the complete example using [bats](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core) and [Terratest](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest) (which tests and deploys the example on AWS), see [test](test).

  What's worth to note is that every AWS SES starts in Sandbox. Sending emails via it (emails not verified in AWS SES) is only allowed after support request.

  SES is avaialable in regions:
  - us-east-1
  - us-west-2
  - ap-south-1
  - ap-southeast-2
  - eu-west-1
  - eu-west-2
  - sa-east-1

  **Note:** This list might change in the future if AWS adds new regions to SES.
